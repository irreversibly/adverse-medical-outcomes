       " 'a wheeze formally called sibilant rhonchi in medical terminology is a continuous coarse whistling sound produced in the respiratory airways during breathing for wheezes to occur some part of the respiratory tree must be narrowed or obstructed or airflow velocity within the respiratory tree must be heightened wheezing is commonly experienced by persons with a lung disease the most common cause of recurrent wheezing is asthma attacks though it can also be a symptom of lung cancer congestive heart failure and certain types of heart diseasesthe differential diagnosis of wheezing is wide and the reason for wheezing in a given patient is determined by considering the characteristics of the wheezes and the historical and clinical findings made by the examining physician characteristics  wheeze wheezes occupy different portions of the respiratory cycle depending on the site of airway obstruction and its nature the fraction of the respiratory cycle during which a wheeze is produced roughly corresponds to the degree of airway obstruction bronchiolar disease usually causes wheezing that occurs in the expiratory phase of respiration the presence of expiratory phase wheezing signifies that the patients peak expiratory flow rate is less than  of normal wheezing heard in the inspiratory phase on the other hand is often a sign of a stiff stenosis usually caused by tumors foreign bodies or scarring this is especially true if the wheeze is monotonal occurs throughout the inspiratory phase ie is holoinspiratory and is heard more proximally in the trachea inspiratory wheezing also occurs in hypersensitivity pneumonitis wheezes heard at the end of both expiratory and inspiratory phases usually signify the periodic opening of deflated alveoli as occurs in some diseases that lead to collapse of parts of the lungsthe location of the wheeze can also be an important clue to the diagnosis diffuse processes that affect most parts of the lungs are more likely to produce wheezing that may be heard throughout the chest via a stethoscope localized processes such as the occlusion of a portion of the respiratory tree are more likely to produce wheezing at that location hence the sound will be loudest and radiate outwardly the pitch of a wheeze does not reliably predict the degree of narrowing in the affected airway stridor a special type of wheeze is stridor stridor — the word is from the latin strīdor — is a harsh highpitched vibrating sound that is heard in respiratory tract obstruction stridor heard solely in the expiratory phase of respiration usually indicates an upper respiratory tract obstruction as with aspiration of a foreign body such as the fabled pediatric peanut stridor in the inspiratory phase is usually heard with obstruction in the upper airways such as the trachea epiglottis or larynx because a block here means that no air may reach either lung this condition is a medical emergency biphasic stridor occurring during both the inspiratory and expiratory phases indicates narrowing at the level of the glottis or subglottis the point between the upper and lower airways diagnosis one out of  preschool children and  out of  school children with recurrent wheezingcoughing are allergic the reaction creates an inflammation that in turn can lead to a variety of symptoms such as wheezingover the last decade allergy has increased by  in the united states today one child in four is allergic early diagnosis of allergy is important for the development of the child later in life there are many patients with symptoms suggesting eczema rhinitis hay fever asthma or wheezing see also crackles also called crepitations or ralesrhonchisquawk sound references  further reading godfrey s uwyyed k springer c avital a mar  is clinical wheezing reliable as the endpoint for bronchial challenges in preschool children pediatr pulmonol   – doippul pmid   external links audio breath sounds  multiple case studies with audio files of lung soundsrale repository  sound files of breath sounds',\n",
       " 'a cough is a sudden and often repetitively occurring protective reflex which helps to clear the large breathing passages from fluids irritants foreign particles and microbes the cough reflex consists of three phases an inhalation a forced exhalation against a closed glottis and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis usually accompanied by a distinctive sound coughing is either voluntary or involuntaryfrequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease many viruses and bacteria benefit from an evolutionary perspective by causing the host to cough which helps to spread the disease to new hosts most of the time irregular coughing is caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking smoking air pollution asthma gastroesophageal reflux disease postnasal drip chronic bronchitis lung tumors heart failure and medications such as ace inhibitorstreatment should target the cause for example smoking cessation or discontinuing ace inhibitors cough suppressants such as codeine or dextromethorphan are frequently prescribed but have been demonstrated to have little effect other treatment options may target airway inflammation or may promote mucus expectoration as it is a natural protective reflex suppressing the cough reflex might have damaging effects especially if the cough is productive presentation  complications the complications of coughing can be classified as either acute or chronic acute complications include cough syncope fainting spells due to decreased blood flow to the brain when coughs are prolonged and forceful insomnia coughinduced vomiting rupture of blebs causing spontaneous pneumothorax although this still remains to be proven subconjunctival hemorrhage or red eye coughing defecation and in women with a prolapsed uterus cough urination chronic complications are common and include abdominal or pelvic hernias fatigue fractures of lower ribs and costochondritis chronic or violent coughing can contribute to damage to the pelvic floor and a possible cystocele differential diagnosis a cough in children may be either a normal physiological reflex or due to an underlying cause in healthy children it may be normal in the absence of any disease to cough ten times a day the most common cause of an acute or subacute cough is a viral respiratory tract infection in adults with a chronic cough ie a cough longer than  weeks more than  of cases are due to postnasal drip asthma eosinophilic bronchitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease the causes of chronic cough are similar in children with the addition of bacterial bronchitis infections a cough can be the result of a respiratory tract infection such as the common cold acute bronchitis pneumonia pertussis or tuberculosis in the vast majority of cases acute coughs ie coughs shorter than  weeks are due to the common cold in people with a normal chest xray tuberculosis is a rare finding pertussis is increasingly being recognised as a cause of troublesome coughing in adultsafter a respiratory tract infection has cleared the person may be left with a postinfectious cough this typically is a dry nonproductive cough that produces no phlegm symptoms may include a tightness in the chest and a tickle in the throat this cough may often persist for weeks after an illness the cause of the cough may be inflammation similar to that observed in repetitive stress disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome the repetition of coughing produces inflammation which produces discomfort which in turn produces more coughing postinfectious cough typically does not respond to conventional cough treatments treatment consists of any antiinflammatory medicine such as ipratropium to treat the inflammation and a cough suppressant to reduce frequency of the cough until inflammation clears inflammation may increase sensitivity to other existing issues such as allergies and treatment of other causes of coughs such as use of an air purifier or allergy medicines may help speed recovery a bronchodilator which helps open up the airways may also help treat this type of cough reactive airway disease when coughing is the only complaint of a person who meets the criteria for asthma bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversibility this is termed coughvariant asthma two related conditions are atopic cough and eosinophilic bronchitis atopic cough occurs in individuals with a family history of atopy an allergic condition abundant eosinophils in the sputum but with normal airway function and responsiveness eosinophilic bronchitis is also characterized by eosinophils in the sputum without airway hyperresponsiveness or an atopic background this condition responds to treatment with corticosteroids cough can also worsen in an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseasthma is a common cause of chronic cough in adults and children coughing may be the only symptom the person has from their asthma or asthma symptoms may also include wheezing shortness of breath and a tight feeling in their chest depending on how severe the asthma is it can be treated with bronchodilators medicine which causes the airways to open up or inhaled steroids treatment of the asthma should make the cough go awaychronic bronchitis is defined clinically as a persistent cough that produces sputum phlegm and mucus for at least three months in two consecutive years chronic bronchitis is often the cause of smokers cough the tobacco smoke causes inflammation secretion of mucus into the airway and difficulty clearing that mucus out of the airways coughing helps clear those secretions out may be treated by quitting smoking may also be caused by pneumoconiosis and longterm fume inhalation gastroesophageal reflux in people with unexplained cough gastroesophageal reflux disease should be considered this occurs when acidic contents of the stomach come back up into the esophagus symptoms usually associated with gerd include heartburn sour taste in the mouth or a feeling of acid reflux in the chest although more than half of the people with cough from gerd don’t have any other symptoms an esophageal ph monitor can confirm the diagnosis of gerd sometimes gerd can complicate respiratory ailments related to cough such as asthma or bronchitis the treatment involves antiacid medications and lifestyle changes with surgery indicated in cases not manageable with conservative measures air pollution coughing may be caused by air pollution including tobacco smoke particulate matter irritant gases and dampness in a home the human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching but principally affect the bodys respiratory system and the cardiovascular system individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to the degree of exposure the individuals health status and genetics people who exercise outdoors on hot smoggy days for example increase their exposure to pollutants in the air foreign body a foreign body can sometimes be suspected for example if the cough started suddenly when the patient was eating rarely sutures left behind inside the airway branches can cause coughing a cough can be triggered by dryness from mouth breathing or recurrent aspiration of food into the windpipe in people with swallowing difficulties angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor angiotensinconverting enzyme ace inhibitors are drugs used in diabetics heart disease and high blood pressure in  of the people who take it it can cause them to have a cough as a side effect cessation of ace inhibitor use is the only way to stop the cough such medicines for hypertension are very common in use such as ramipril and quinapril there are cases of cough of unknown origin who had resolution with stopping the drug psychogenic cough a psychogenic cough habit cough or tic cough may be the cause in the absence of a physical problem in these instances emotional and psychological problems are suspected however other illnesses have to be ruled out before a firm diagnosis of psychogenic cough is madepsychogenic cough is thought to be more common in children than in adults a possible scenario psychogenic cough develops in a child who has a chronically ill brother or sister neurogenic cough some cases of chronic cough may be attributed to a sensory neuropathic disorder treatment for neurogenic cough may include the use of certain neuralgia medications coughing may occur in tic disorders such as tourette syndrome although it should be distinguished from throatclearing in this disorder other cough may also be caused by conditions affecting the lung tissue such as bronchiectasis cystic fibrosis interstitial lung diseases and sarcoidosis coughing can also be triggered by benign or malignant lung tumors or mediastinal masses through irritation of the nerve diseases of the external auditory canal wax for example can also cause cough cardiovascular diseases associated with cough are heart failure pulmonary infarction and aortic aneurysm nocturnal cough is associated with heart failure as the heart does not compensate for the increased volume shift to the pulmonary circulation in turn causing pulmonary edema and resultant cough other causes of nocturnal cough include asthma postnasal drip and gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd another cause of cough occurring preferentially in supine position is recurrent aspirationgiven its irritant nature to mammal tissues capsaicin is widely used to determine the cough threshold and as a tussive stimulant in clinical research of cough suppressants capsaicin is what makes chili peppers spicy and might explain why workers in factories with these fruits can develop a coughcoughing may also be used for social reasons such as coughing before giving a speech coughing is not always involuntary and can be used in social situations coughing can be used to attract attention release internal psychological tension or become a maladaptive displacement behavior it is believed that the frequency of such coughing increases in environments vulnerable to psychological tension and social conflict in such environments coughing may become one of many displacement behaviors or defense mechanisms pathophysiology a cough is a protective reflex in healthy individuals which is influenced by psychological factors the cough reflex is initiated by stimulation of two different classes of afferent nerves namely the myelinated rapidly adapting receptors and nonmyelinated cfibers with endings in the lungs however it is not certain that the stimulation of nonmyelinated cfibers leads to cough with a reflex as its meant in physiology with its own five components this stimulation may cause mast cells degranulation through an assoassonic reflex and edema which may work as a stimulus for rapidly adapting receptors diagnostic approach the type of cough may help in the diagnosis for instance an inspiratory whooping sound on coughing almost doubles the likelihood that the illness is pertussisblood may occur in small amounts with severe cough of many causes but larger amounts suggests bronchitis bronchiectasis tuberculosis or primary lung cancerfurther workup may include labs xrays and spirometry classification a cough can be classified by its duration character quality and timing the duration can be either acute of sudden onset if it is present less than three weeks subacute if it is present between three or eight weeks and chronic when lasting longer than eight weeks a cough can be nonproductive dry or productive when sputum is coughed up it may occur only at night then called nocturnal cough during both night and day or just during the daya number of characteristic coughs exist while these have not been found to be diagnostically useful in adults they are of use in children a barky cough is part of the common presentation of croup while a staccato cough has been classically described with chlamydia pneumonia treatment the treatment of a cough in children is based on the underlying cause in children half of cases go away without treatment in  days and  in  daysaccording to the american academy of pediatrics the use of cough medicine to relieve cough symptoms is supported by little evidence and thus not recommended for treating cough symptoms in children there is tentative evidence that the use of honey is better than no treatment or diphenhydramine in decreasing coughing it does not alleviate coughing to the same extent as dextromethorphan a trial of antibiotics or inhaled corticosteroids may be tried in children with a chronic cough in an attempt to treat protracted bacterial bronchitis

       " 'shortness of breath also known as dyspnea is a feeling like one cannot breathe well enough the american thoracic society defines it as a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity and recommends evaluating dyspnea by assessing the intensity of the distinct sensations the degree of distress involved and its burden or impact on activities of daily living distinct sensations include effortwork chest tightness and air hunger the feeling of not enough oxygendyspnea is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations or light exertion in  of cases it is due to asthma pneumonia cardiac ischemia interstitial lung disease congestive heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or psychogenic causes such as panic disorder and anxiety treatment typically depends on the underlying cause definition the american thoracic society defines dyspnea as a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity other definitions describe it as difficulty in breathing disordered or inadequate breathing uncomfortable awareness of breathing and as the experience of breathlessness which may be either acute or chronic differential diagnosis while shortness of breath is generally caused by disorders of the cardiac or respiratory system other systems such as neurological musculoskeletal endocrine hematologic and psychiatric may be the cause diagnosispro an online medical expert system listed  distinct causes in october  the most common cardiovascular causes are acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure while common pulmonary causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma pneumothorax pulmonary edema and pneumonia on a pathophysiological basis the causes can be divided into  an increased awareness of normal breathing such as during an anxiety attack  an increase in the work of breathing and  an abnormality in the ventilatory system acute coronary syndrome acute coronary syndrome frequently presents with retrosternal chest discomfort and difficulty catching the breath it however may atypically present with shortness of breath alone risk factors include old age smoking hypertension hyperlipidemia and diabetes an electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes are important both for diagnosis and directing treatment treatment involves measures to decrease the oxygen requirement of the heart and efforts to increase blood flow congestive heart failure congestive heart failure frequently presents with shortness of breath with exertion orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea it affects between – of the general united states population and occurs in  of those over  years old risk factors for acute decompensation include high dietary salt intake medication noncompliance cardiac ischemia dysrhythmias renal failure pulmonary emboli hypertension and infections treatment efforts are directed towards decreasing lung congestion chronic obstructive pulmonary disease people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd most commonly emphysema or chronic bronchitis frequently have chronic shortness of breath and a chronic productive cough an acute exacerbation presents with increased shortness of breath and sputum production copd is a risk factor for pneumonia thus this condition should be ruled out in an acute exacerbation treatment is with a combination of anticholinergics betaadrenoceptor agonists steroids and possibly positive pressure ventilation asthma asthma is the most common reason for presenting to the emergency room with shortness of breath it is the most common lung disease in both developing and developed countries affecting about  of the population other symptoms include wheezing tightness in the chest and a non productive cough inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for children however these drugs can reduce the growth rate acute symptoms are treated with shortacting bronchodilators pneumothorax pneumothorax presents typically with pleuritic chest pain of acute onset and shortness of breath not improved with oxygen physical findings may include absent breath sounds on one side of the chest jugular venous distension and tracheal deviation pneumonia the symptoms of pneumonia are fever productive cough shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain inspiratory crackles may be heard on exam a chest xray can be useful to differentiate pneumonia from congestive heart failure as the cause is usually a bacterial infection antibiotics are typically used for treatmentseverity and prognosis of pneumonia can be estimated from curb where cconfusion u uremia  rrespiratory rate  b bp  age pulmonary embolism pulmonary embolism classically presents with an acute onset of shortness of breath other presenting symptoms include pleuritic chest pain cough hemoptysis and fever risk factors include deep vein thrombosis recent surgery cancer and previous thromboembolism it must always be considered in those with acute onset of shortness of breath owing to its high risk of mortality diagnosis however may be difficult and wells score is often used to assess the clinical probability treatment depending on severity of symptoms typically starts with anticoagulants the presence of ominous signs low blood pressure may warrant the use of thrombolytic drugs anaemia anaemia that develops gradually usually presents with exertional dyspnea fatigue weakness and tachycardia it may lead to heart failure anaemia caused by low haemoglobin levels is often a cause of dyspnea menstruation particularly if excessive can contribute to anaemia and to consequential dyspnea in women headaches are also a symptom of dyspnea in patients suffering from anaemia some patients report a numb sensation in their head and others have reported blurred vision caused by hypotension behind the eye due to a lack of oxygen and pressure these patients have also reported severe head pains many of which lead to permanent brain damage symptoms can include loss of concentration focus fatigue language faculty impairment and memory loss other other important or common causes of shortness of breath include cardiac tamponade anaphylaxis interstitial lung disease panic attacks and pulmonary hypertension cardiac tamponade presents with dyspnea tachycardia elevated jugular venous pressure and pulsus paradoxus the gold standard for diagnosis is ultrasound anaphylaxis typically begins over a few minutes in a person with a previous history of the same other symptoms include urticaria throat swelling and gastrointestinal upset the primary treatment is epinephrine interstitial lung disease presents with gradual onset of shortness of breath typically with a history of a predisposing environmental exposure shortness of breath is often the only symptom in those with tachydysrhythmias panic attacks typically present with hyperventilation sweating and numbness they are however a diagnosis of exclusion around  of women experience shortness of breath as a part of a normal pregnancy neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury phrenic nerve injuries guillain–barré syndrome amyotrophic lateral sclerosis multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy can all cause an individual to experience shortness of breath shortness of breath can also occur as a result of vocal cord dysfunction vcd pathophysiology different physiological pathways may lead to shortness of breath including via asic chemoreceptors mechanoreceptors and lung receptorsit is thought that three main components contribute to dyspnea afferent signals efferent signals and central information processing it is believed the central processing in the brain compares the afferent and efferent signals and dyspnea results when a mismatch occurs between the two such as when the need for ventilation afferent signaling is not being met by physical breathing efferent signalingafferent signals are sensory neuronal signals that ascend to the brain afferent neurons significant in dyspnea arise from a large number of sources including the carotid bodies medulla lungs and chest wall chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and medulla supply information regarding the blood gas levels of o co and h in the lungs juxtacapillary j receptors are sensitive to pulmonary interstitial edema while stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction muscle spindles in the chest wall signal the stretch and tension of the respiratory muscles thus poor ventilation leading to hypercapnia left heart failure leading to interstitial edema impairing gas exchange asthma causing bronchoconstriction limiting airflow and muscle fatigue leading to ineffective respiratory muscle action could all contribute to a feeling of dyspneaefferent signals are the motor neuronal signals descending to the respiratory muscles the most important respiratory muscle is the diaphragm other respiratory muscles include the external and internal intercostal muscles the abdominal muscles and the accessory breathing musclesas the brain receives its plentiful supply of afferent information relating to ventilation it is able to compare it to the current level of respiration as determined by the efferent signals if the level of respiration is inappropriate for the bodys status then dyspnea might occur there is also a psychological component to dyspnea as some people may become aware of their breathing in such circumstances but not experience the distress typical of dyspnea evaluation the initial approach to evaluation begins by assessment of the airway breathing and circulation followed by a medical history and physical examination signs that represent significant severity include hypotension hypoxemia tracheal deviation altered mental status unstable dysrhythmia stridor intercostal indrawing cyanosis tripod positioning pronounced use of accessory muscles sternocleidomastoid scalenes and absent breath soundsa number of scales may be used to quantify the degree of shortness of breath it may be subjectively rated on a scale from  to  with descriptors associated with the number the modified borg scale alternatively a scale such as the mrc breathlessness scale might be used – it suggests five grades of dyspnea based on the circumstances in which it arises blood tests a number of labs may be helpful in determining the cause of shortness of breath ddimer while useful to rule out a pulmonary embolism in those who are at low risk is not of much value if it is positive as it may be positive in a number of conditions that lead to shortness of breath a low level of brain natriuretic peptide is useful in ruling out congestive heart failure however a high level while supportive of the diagnosis could also be due to advanced age renal failure acute coronary syndrome or a large pulmonary embolism imaging a chest xray is useful to confirm or rule out a pneumothorax pulmonary edema or pneumonia spiral computed tomography with intravenous radiocontrast is the imaging study of choice to evaluate for pulmonary embolism treatment in those who are not palliative the primary treatment of shortness of breath is directed at its underlying cause extra oxygen is effective in those with hypoxia however this has no effect in those with normal blood oxygen saturations even in those who are palliative physiotherapy individuals can benefit from a variety of physical therapy interventions persons with neurologicalneuromuscular abnormalities may have breathing difficulties due to weak or paralyzed intercostal abdominal andor other muscles needed for ventilation some physical therapy interventions for this population include active assisted cough techniques volume augmentation such as breath stacking education about body position and ventilation patterns and movement strategies to facilitate breathing palliative along with the measure above systemic immediate release opioids are beneficial in emergently reducing the symptom of shortness of breath due to both cancer and non cancer causes longactingsustainedrelease opioids are also used to preventcontinue treatment of dyspnea in palliative setting pulmonary rehabilitation may alleviate symptoms in some people such as those with copd but will not cure the underlying disease there is a lack of evidence to recommend midazolam nebulised opioids the use of gas mixtures or cognitivebehavioral therapy epidemiology shortness of breath is the primary reason  of people present to the emergency department in the united states of these individuals approximately  are admitted to the hospital and  are dead within a year some studies have suggested that up to  of people suffer from dyspnea while in dying patients  will experience it acute shortness of breath is the most common reason people requiring palliative care visit an emergency department etymology and pronunciation english dyspnea comes from latin dyspnoea from greek dyspnoia from dyspnoos which literally means disordered breathing its combining forms dys  pnea are familiar from other medical words such as dysfunction dys  function and apnea a  pnea the most common pronunciation in medical english is  dispneeə with the p expressed and the stress on the niː syllable but pronunciations with a silent p in pn as also in pneumo are common  or  as are those with the stress on the first syllable  or in english the various pneasuffixed words commonly used in medicine do not follow one clear pattern as to whether the first syllable or the niː syllable is stressed the p is usually expressed but is sometimes silent the following collation shows the preponderance of how major dictionaries transcribe them lessused variants are omitted regarding the p in greek pn one prescription holds that it is silent only when wordinitial not when intersyllabic by this principle although it is silent in pneumatic it would be heard in any of the pneasuffixed terms the invariability of this principle may be descriptively true for ancient greek but it is not descriptively true

       " 'choking also known as foreign body airway obstruction is a lifethreatening medical emergency characterized by the blockage of air passage into the lungs secondary to the inhalation or ingestion of food or another object choking is caused by a mechanical obstruction of the airway that prevents normal breathing this obstruction can be partial allowing some air passage into the lungs or complete no air passage into the lungs the disruption of normal breathing by choking deprives oxygen delivery to the body resulting in asphyxia although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops this sequence of events is potentially fatal choking was the fourth most common cause of unintentional injuryrelated death in the us in deaths from choking most often occur in the very young children under  years old and in the elderly adults over  years obstruction of the airway can occur at the level of the pharynx or the trachea foods that can adapt their shape to that of the pharynx such as bananas marshmallows or gelatinous candies can be a danger not just for children but for persons of any agechoking is one type of airway obstruction which includes any blockage of the airconducting passages including blockage due to tumors swelling of the airway tissues and compression of the laryngopharynx larynx or vertebrate trachea in strangulation symptoms and signs difficulty or inability to speak or cry outinability or difficulty breathing labored breathing including gasping or wheezing may be presentviolent and largely involuntary coughing gurgling or vomiting noises may be presentmore serious choking victims will have a limited if any ability to produce these symptoms since they require at least some air movementthe person may begin clutching of the throat or mouth or attempting to induce vomiting by putting fingers down the throatthe persons face turns blue cyanosis from lack of oxygen if breathing is not restoredthe person may become unconscious if breathing is not restored complications brain damage typically occurs if the body is deprived of air for three minutesdeath will usually occur if breathing is not restored in six to eight minutes cause choking is caused by an object from outside the body also called a foreign body blocking the airway the object can block the upper or lower airway passages the airway obstruction is usually partial but can also be completeamong children the most common causes of choking are food coins toys and balloons in one study peanuts were the most common object found in the airway of children evaluated for suspected foreign body aspiration foods that pose a high risk of choking include hot dogs hard candy nuts seeds whole grapes raw carrots apples popcorn peanut butter marshmallows chewing gum and sausages the most common cause of choking death in children is latex balloons small round nonfood objects such as balls marbles toys and toy parts are also associated with a high risk of choking death because of their potential to completely block a childs airwaychildren younger than age three are especially at risk of choking because they explore the environment by putting objects in their mouth also young children are still developing the ability to chew food completely molar teeth which come in around  years of age are necessary for grinding food even after molar teeth are present children continue developing the ability to chew food completely and swallow throughout early childhood in addition a childs airway is smaller in diameter than an adults airway which means that smaller objects can cause an airway obstruction in children infants and young children generate a less forceful cough than adults so coughing may not be as effective in relieving an airway obstruction finally children with neuromuscular disorders developmental delay traumatic brain injury and other conditions that affect swallowing are at an increased risk of chokingin adults choking often involves food blocking the airway risk factors include using alcohol or sedatives undergoing a procedure involving the oral cavity or pharynx wearing oral appliances or having a medical condition that causes difficulty swallowing or impairs the cough reflex conditions that can cause difficulty swallowing andor impaired coughing include neurologic conditions such as strokes alzheimer disease or parkinson disease in older adults risk factors also include living alone wearing dentures and having difficulty swallowingchildren and adults with neurologic cognitive or psychiatric disorders may experience a delay in diagnosis because there may not be a known history of a foreign body entering the airway prevention providers such as pediatricians and dentists can provide information to parents and caregivers about what food and toys are appropriate by age to prevent choking the american academy of pediatricians recommends waiting until  months of age before introducing solid foods to infants caregivers can supervise children while eating or playing also caregivers can avoid giving children younger than  foods that pose a high risk of choking such as hot dog pieces cheese sticks cheese chunks hard candy nuts grapes marshmallows or popcorn parents teachers child care providers and other caregivers for children get training in choking first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation cprin the us manufacturers of childrens toys and products must follow requirements to prevent choking and include appropriate warning labels however toys that are resold may not be marked with warning labels caregivers can try to prevent choking by considering the features of a toy such as size shape consistency small parts before giving it to a child childrens products that are found to pose a choking risk can be recalled treatment choking is treated with a number of different procedures with both basic techniques available for first aiders and more advanced techniques available for health professionals basic treatment basic treatment of choking includes a number of noninvasive techniques to help remove foreign bodies from the airways most modern protocols including those of the american heart association and the american red cross recommend several stages designed to apply increasingly more pressure for the conscious choking victim most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough followed by hard back slaps and if none of these things work abdominal thrusts heimlich maneuver or chest thrusts once the choking victims loses consciousness initiating cpr is recommended cough if the choking individual is conscious and coughing the american red cross recommends encouraging the individual to continue coughing the american red cross recommends that if the person choking is unable to cough or if coughing is not effective to move onto other methods detailed below back blows or slaps the mayo clinic recommends the use of back blows to aid in the rescue of choking victims back slaps are performed by leaning the choking victim forward then delivering blows with the heel of the hand onto the victims back in between their shoulder blades if back slaps are performed they must be performed with the head lower than the chest ie bend the person over when you slap them hard between the shoulder blades with the heel of the palm otherwise the blow may drive the object deeper into the persons throat abdominal thrusts heimlich maneuver although the american heart association cites back slaps as effective for relief of choking the organization recommends use of abdominal thrusts for simplicity followed by chest thrusts if abdominal thrusts are not effective abdominal thrusts are performed with the rescuer standing behind the person choking and exerting inward and upward pressure with their hands on the choking persons abdomen the purpose of abdominal thrusts is to create pressure that will expel any object lodged in the airway upwards to relive the obstruction five and five technique the american red cross recommends a strategy of alternating five back slaps and five abdominal thrusts for all conscious choking people until the object blocking the airway is dislodged if the person choking becomes unconscious basic cpr is recommended finger sweep if the choking victim becomes unconscious the american medical association advocates sweeping the fingers across the back of the throat to attempt to dislodge airway obstructions however many modern protocols recommend against the use of the finger sweep since if the patient is conscious they will be able to remove the foreign object themselves or if they are unconscious the rescuer should simply place them in the recovery position as this allows to a certain extent the drainage of fluids out of the mouth instead of down the trachea due to gravity there is also a risk of causing further damage for instance inducing vomiting by using a finger sweep technique there are no studies that have examined the usefulness of the finger sweep technique when there is no visible object in the airway recommendations for the use of the finger sweep have been based on anecdotal evidence selftreatment the heimlich maneuver abdominal thrusts can be performed or can be selfadministered selfadministration of this maneuver requires positioning of ones own abdomen over a chair railing or countertop and driving the abdomen upon the object with sharp upward thrust this serves as a substitute for thrusts made with the hands by another person one study showed that these selfadministered abdominal thrusts were just as effective as those performed by another person although obese individuals were not included in the study selfassist choking devices are another selftreatment option this device is used to produce the inward and upward force of traditional abdominal thrusts multiple sources of evidence suggest that one of promising approaches for self treatment during choking could be by applying the headdown inversed position special treatment populations  infants less than  year for children less than  year the american heart association recommends performing cycles of  back blows or slaps followed by  chest compressions these cycles of  back blows then  chest compressions are repeated until the object comes out of the infants airway or until the infant becomes unresponsive if the infant becomes unresponsive the american heart association recommends starting cpr the reason that abdominal thrusts are not recommended in children less than  year is because they can cause liver damage pregnant or obese persons the american heart association recommends chest thrusts rather than abdominal thrusts for pregnant or obese persons who are choking chest thrusts are performed in a similar to the abdominal thrusts but with a change in hand placement of the rescuer the hands are placed on the lower part of the choking victims chest at the base of the breastbone or sternum rather than over the middle of the abdomen as in traditional abdominal thrusts strong inward thrusts are then applied advanced treatment there are many advanced medical treatments to relieve choking or airway obstruction these include inspection of the airway with a laryngoscope or bronchoscope and removal of the object under direct vision severe cases where there is an inability to remove the object may require cricothyrotomy emergency tracheostomy cricothyrotomy involves making an incision in a patients neck and inserting a tube into the trachea in order to bypass the upper airways the procedure is usually only performed when other methods have failed in many cases an emergency tracheostomy can save a patients life but if performed incorrectly it may end the patient’s life epidemiology choking is the fourth most common cause of unintentional injuryrelated death in the us many episodes are not reported because they are brief and resolve without seeking medical attention among reported events the majority of episodes  occur among children younger than age  with fewer episodes  among age  and older the death rate from choking is low at most ages but increases starting around age  choking due to a foreign object resulted in  deaths  per  in  compared to  deaths  per  in  notable cases the

       " 'posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd is a mental disorder that can develop after a person is exposed to a traumatic event such as sexual assault warfare traffic collisions or other threats on a persons life symptoms may include disturbing thoughts feelings or dreams related to the events mental or physical distress to traumarelated cues attempts to avoid traumarelated cues alterations in how a person thinks and feels and an increase in the fightorflight response these symptoms last for more than a month after the event young children are less likely to show distress but instead may express their memories through play a person with ptsd is at a higher risk for suicide and intentional selfharmmost people who have experienced a traumatic event will not develop ptsd people who experience interpersonal trauma for example rape or child abuse are more likely to develop ptsd as compared to people who experience nonassault based trauma such as accidents and natural disasters about half of people develop ptsd following rape children are less likely than adults to develop ptsd after trauma especially if they are under ten years of age diagnosis is based on the presence of specific symptoms following a traumatic eventprevention may be possible when therapy is targeted at those with early symptoms but is not effective when provided to all individuals whether or not symptoms are present the main treatments for people with ptsd are counselling and medication a number of different types of therapy may be useful this may occur oneonone or in a group antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor type are the firstline medications for ptsd and result in benefit in about half of people these benefits are less than those seen with therapy it is unclear if using medications and therapy together has greater benefit other medications do not have enough evidence to support their use and in the case of benzodiazepines may worsen outcomesin the united states about  of adults have ptsd in a given year and  of people develop it at some point in their life in much of the rest of the world rates during a given year are between  and  higher rates may occur in regions of armed conflict it is more common in women than men symptoms of traumarelated mental disorders have been documented since at least the time of the ancient greeks during the world wars the condition was known under various terms including shell shock and combat neurosis the term posttraumatic stress disorder came into use in the s in large part due to the diagnoses of us military veterans of the vietnam war it was officially recognized by the american psychiatric association in  in the third edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsmiii signs and symptoms symptoms of ptsd generally begin within the first  months after the inciting traumatic event but may not begin until years later in the typical case the individual with ptsd persistently avoids traumarelated thoughts and emotions and discussion of the traumatic event and may even have amnesia of the event however the event is commonly relived by the individual through intrusive recurrent recollections dissociative episodes of reliving the trauma flashbacks and nightmares while it is common to have symptoms after any traumatic event these must persist to a sufficient degree ie causing dysfunction in life or clinical levels of distress for longer than one month after the trauma to be classified as ptsd clinically significant dysfunction or distress for less than one month after the trauma may be acute stress disorder associated medical conditions drug abuse and alcohol abuse commonly cooccur with ptsd recovery from posttraumatic stress disorder or other anxiety disorders may be hindered or the condition worsened when substance use disorders are comorbid with ptsd resolving these problems can bring about improvement in an individuals mental health status and anxiety levels risk factors persons considered at risk include combat military personnel victims of natural disasters concentration camp survivors and victims of violent crime persons employed in occupations that expose them to violence such as soldiers or disasters such as emergency service workers are also at risk other occupations that are at higher risk include police officers firefighters ambulance personnel health care professionals train drivers divers journalists and sailors in addition to people who work at banks post offices or in stores the size of the hippocampus is inversely related to posttraumatic stress disorder and treatment success the smaller the hippocampus the higher risk of ptsd trauma ptsd has been associated with a wide range of traumatic events the risk of developing ptsd after a traumatic event varies by trauma type and is highest following exposure to sexual violence  particularly rape  men are more likely to experience a traumatic event but women are more likely to experience the kind of highimpact traumatic event that can lead to ptsd such as interpersonal violence and sexual assaultposttraumatic stress reactions have not been studied as well in children and adolescents as adults the rate of ptsd may be lower in children than adults but in the absence of therapy symptoms may continue for decades one estimate suggests that the proportion of children and adolescents having ptsd in a nonwartorn population in a developed country may be  compared to  to  of adults and much lower below the age of  years on average  of children exposed to a traumatic event develop ptsd varying according to type of exposure and genderpredictor models have consistently found that childhood trauma chronic adversity and familial stressors increase risk for ptsd as well as risk for biological markers of risk for ptsd after a traumatic event in adulthood experiencing bullying as a child or an adult has been correlated with the development of ptsd peritraumatic dissociation in children is a predictive indicator of the development of ptsd later in life this effect of childhood trauma which is not well understood may be a marker for both traumatic experiences and attachment problems proximity to duration of and severity of the trauma make an impact and interpersonal traumas cause more problems than impersonal onesthe risk of developing ptsd is increased in individuals who are exposed to physical abuse physical assault or kidnapping women who experience physical violence are more likely to develop ptsd than men intimate partner violence an individual that has been exposed to domestic violence is predisposed to the development of ptsd however being exposed to a traumatic experience does not automatically indicate that an individual will develop ptsd there is a strong association between the development of ptsd in mothers that experienced domestic violence during the perinatal period of their pregnancythose who have experienced sexual assault or rape may develop symptoms of ptsd ptsd symptoms include reexperiencing the assault avoiding things associated with the assault numbness and increased anxiety and an increased startle response the likelihood of sustained symptoms of ptsd is higher if the rapist confined or restrained the person if the person being raped believed the rapist would kill him or her the person who was raped was very young or very old and if the rapist was someone he or she knew the likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore or are ignorant of the rape or blame the rape survivor warrelated trauma military service is a risk factor for developing ptsd around  of people exposed to combat do not develop ptsd in about  of military personnel who develop ptsd its appearance is delayedrefugees are also at an increased risk for ptsd due to their exposure to war hardships and traumatic events the rates for ptsd within refugee populations range from  to  while the stresses of war impact everyone involved displaced persons have been shown to be more affected than nondisplaced persons unexpected death of a loved one sudden unexpected death of a loved one is the most common traumatic event type reported in crossnational studies however the majority of people who experience this type of event will not go on to develop ptsd an analysis from the who world mental health surveys found a  risk of developing ptsd after learning of the unexpected death of a loved one because of the high prevalence of this type of traumatic event unexpected death of a loved one accounts for approximately  of ptsd cases worldwide lifethreatening illness medical conditions associated with an increased risk of ptsd include cancer heart attack and stroke intensivecare unit icu hospitalization is also a risk factor for ptsd some women experience ptsd from their experiences related to breast cancer and mastectomy pregnancyrelated trauma women who experience miscarriage are at risk of ptsd those who experience subsequent miscarriages have an increased risk of ptsd compared to those experiencing only one ptsd can also occur after childbirth and the risk increases if a woman has experienced trauma prior to the pregnancy prevalence of ptsd following normal childbirth that is excluding stillbirth or major complications is estimated to be between  and  at  weeks postpartum with rates dropping to  at  months postpartum symptoms of ptsd are common following childbirth with prevalence of  at  weeks dropping to  at  months emergency childbirth is also associated with ptsd some women experience ptsd from their experiences related to breast cancer and mastectomy genetics there is evidence that susceptibility to ptsd is hereditary approximately  of the variance in ptsd is caused from genetics alone for twin pairs exposed to combat in vietnam having a monozygotic identical twin with ptsd was associated with an increased risk of the cotwins having ptsd compared to twins that were dizygotic nonidentical twins there is evidence that those with a genetically smaller hippocampus are more likely to develop ptsd following a traumatic event research has also found that ptsd shares many genetic influences common to other psychiatric disorders panic and generalized anxiety disorders and ptsd share  of the same genetic variance alcohol nicotine and drug dependence share greater than  genetic similaritiesseveral biological indicators have been identified that are related to later ptsd development heightened startle responses and a smaller hippocampal volume have been identified as biomarkers for the risk of developing ptsd additionally one study found that soldiers whose leukocytes had greater numbers of glucocorticoid receptors were more prone to developing ptsd after experiencing trauma pathophysiology  neuroendocrinology ptsd symptoms may result when a traumatic event causes an overreactive adrenaline response which creates deep neurological patterns in the brain these patterns can persist long after the event that triggered the fear making an individual hyperresponsive to future fearful situations during traumatic experiences the high levels of stress hormones secreted suppress hypothalamic activity that may be a major factor toward the development of ptsdptsd causes biochemical changes in the brain and body that differ from other psychiatric disorders such as major depression individuals diagnosed with ptsd respond more strongly to a dexamethasone suppression test than individuals diagnosed with clinical depressionmost people with ptsd show a low secretion of cortisol and high secretion of catecholamines in urine with a norepinephrinecortisol ratio consequently higher than comparable nondiagnosed individuals this is in contrast to the normative fightorflight response in which both catecholamine and cortisol levels are elevated after exposure to a stressorbrain catecholamine levels are high and corticotropinreleasing factor crf concentrations are high together these findings suggest abnormality in the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal hpa axisthe maintenance of fear has been shown to include the hpa axis the locus coeruleusnoradrenergic systems and the connections between the limbic system and frontal cortex the hpa axis that coordinates the hormonal response to stress which activates the lcnoradrenergic system is implicated in the overconsolidation of memories that occurs in the aftermath of trauma this overconsolidation increases the likelihood of ones developing ptsd the amygdala is responsible for threat detection and the conditioned and unconditioned fear responses that are carried out as a response to a threatthe hpa axis is responsible for coordinating the hormonal response to stress given the strong cortisol suppression to dexamethasone in ptsd hpa axis abnormalities are likely predicated on strong negative feedback inhibition of cortisol itself likely due to an increased sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors ptsd has been hypothesized to be a maladaptive learning pathway to fear response through a hypersensitive hyperreactive and hyperresponsive hpa axislow cortisol levels may predispose individuals to ptsd following war trauma swedish soldiers serving in bosnia and herzegovina with low preservice salivary cortisol levels had a higher risk of reacting with ptsd symptoms following war trauma than soldiers with normal preservice levels because cortisol is normally important in restoring homeostasis after the stress response it is thought that trauma survivors with low cortisol experience a poorly contained—that is longer and more distressing—response setting the stage for ptsdit is thought that the locus coeruleusnoradrenergic system mediates the overconsolidation of fear memory high levels of cortisol reduce noradrenergic activity and because people with ptsd tend to have reduced levels of cortisol it has been proposed that individuals with ptsd cannot regulate the increased noradrenergic response to traumatic stress intrusive memories and conditioned fear responses are thought to be a result of the response to associated triggers neuropeptide y has been reported to reduce the release of norepinephrine and has been demonstrated to have anxiolytic properties in animal models studies have shown people with ptsd demonstrate reduced levels of npy possibly indicating their increased anxiety levelsother studies indicate that people that suffer from ptsd have chronically low levels of serotonin which contributes to the commonly associated behavioral symptoms such as anxiety ruminations irritability aggression suicidality and impulsivity serotonin also contributes to the stabilization of glucocorticoid productiondopamine levels in a person with ptsd can help contribute to the symptoms associated low levels of dopamine can contribute to anhedonia apathy impaired attention and motor deficits increased levels of dopamine can cause psychosis agitation and restlessnessmultiple studies described elevated concentrations of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine in ptsd this kind of type  allostatic adaptation may contribute to increased sensitivity to catecholamines and other stress mediatorshyperresponsiveness in the norepinephrine system can also be caused by continued exposure to high stress overactivation of norepinephrine receptors in the prefrontal cortex can be connected to the flashbacks and nightmares frequently experienced by those with ptsd a decrease in other norepinephrine functions awareness of the current environment prevents the memory mechanisms in the brain from processing that the experience and emotions the person is experiencing during a flashback are not associated with the current environmentthere is considerable controversy within the medical community regarding the neurobiology of ptsd a  review showed no clear relationship between cortisol levels and ptsd the majority of reports indicate people with ptsd have elevated levels of corticotropinreleasing hormone lower basal cortisol levels and enhanced negative feedback suppression of the hpa axis by dexamethasone neuroanatomy the three brain areas with changed function are the prefrontal cortex amygdala and hippocampus much of this research stems from ptsd victims from the vietnam warptsd patients have decreased brain activity in the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex areas linked to the experience and regulation of emotionthe amygdala is strongly involved in forming emotional memories especially fearrelated memories during high stress the hippocampus which is associated with placing memories in the correct context of space and time and memory recall is suppressed according to one theory this suppression may be the cause of the flashbacks that can affect people with ptsd when someone with ptsd undergoes stimuli similar to the traumatic event the body perceives the event as occurring again because the memory was never properly recorded in the persons memorythe amygdalocentric model of ptsd proposes that the amygdala is very much aroused and insufficiently controlled by the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus in particular during extinction this is consistent with an interpretation of ptsd as a syndrome of deficient extinction abilitythe basolateral nucleus bla of the amygdala is responsible for the comparison and development of associations between unconditioned and conditioned responses to stimuli which results in the fear conditioning present in ptsd the bla activates the central nucleus cea of the amygdala which elaborates the fear response including behavioral response to threat and elevated startle response descending inhibitory inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex mpfc regulate the transmission from the bla to the cea which is hypothesized to play a role in the extinction of conditioned fear responses while as a whole amygdala hyperactivity is reported by meta analysis of functional neuroimaging in ptsd there is a large degree of heterogeniety more so than in social anxiety disorder or phobic disorder comparing dorsalroughly the cea and ventralroughly the bla clusters hyperactivity is more robust in the ventral cluster while hypoactivity is evident in the dorsal cluster the distinction may explain the blunted emotions in ptsdvia desensitization in the cea as well as the fear related componentin a  study vietnam war combat veterans with ptsd showed a  reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms this finding was not replicated in chronic ptsd patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in  ramstein germany diagnosis ptsd can be particularly difficult to diagnose because numerous factors can lead to overreporting eg disability and underreporting eg avoidance symptoms dysfunction and distress screening and assessment a number of screening instruments are used for screening adults for ptsd such as the ptsd checklist for dsm pcl and the primary care ptsd screen for dsm pcptsdthere are also several screening and assessment instruments for use with children and adolescents these include the child ptsd symptom scale cpss child trauma screening questionnaire and ucla posttraumatic stress disorder reaction index for dsmivin addition there are also screening and assessment instruments for caregivers of very young children six years of age and younger these include the young child ptsd screen the young child ptsd checklist and the diagnostic infant and preschool assessment diagnostic and statistical manual ptsd was classified as an anxiety disorder in the dsmiv but has since been reclassified as a trauma and stressorrelated disorder in the dsm the dsm diagnostic criteria for ptsd include four symptom clusters reexperiencing avoidance negative alterations in cognitionmood and alterations in arousal and reactivity international classification of diseases the international classification of diseases and related health problems  icd classifies ptsd under reaction to severe stress and adjustment disorders the icd criteria for ptsd include reexperiencing avoidance and either increased reactivity or inability to recall certain details related to the event differential diagnosis a diagnosis of ptsd requires that the person has been exposed to an extreme stressor such as one that is lifethreatening any stressor can result in a diagnosis of adjustment disorder and it is an appropriate diagnosis for a stressor and a symptom pattern that does not meet the criteria for ptsd for example a partner being fired or a spouse leaving if any of the symptom pattern is present before the stressor another diagnosis is required such as brief psychotic disorder or major depressive disorder other differential diagnoses are schizophrenia or other disorders with psychotic features such as psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition druginduced psychotic disorders can be considered if substance abuse is involvedthe symptom pattern for acute stress disorder must occur and be resolved within four weeks of the trauma if it lasts longer and the symptom pattern fits that characteristic of ptsd the diagnosis may be changedobsessive compulsive disorder may be diagnosed for intrusive thoughts that are recurring but not related to a specific traumatic event prevention modest benefits have been seen from early access to cognitive behavioral therapy critical incident stress management has been suggested as a means of preventing ptsd but subsequent studies suggest the likelihood of its producing negative outcomes a review did not find any evidence to support the use of an intervention offered to everyone and that multiple session interventions may result in worse outcome than no intervention for some individuals the world health organization recommends against the use of benzodiazepines and antidepressants in those having experienced trauma some evidence supports the use of hydrocortisone for prevention in adults however there is limited or no evidence supporting propranolol escitalopram temazepam or gabapentin psychological debriefing traumaexposed individuals often receive treatment called psychological debriefing in an effort to prevent ptsd which consists of interviews that are meant to allow individuals to directly confront the event and share their feelings with the counselor and to help structure their memories of the event however several metaanalyses find that psychological debriefing is unhelpful and is potentially harmful this is true for both singlesession debriefing and multiple session interventions as of  the american psychological association assessed psychological debriefing as no research supporttreatment is potentially harmful risktargeted interventions risktargeted interventions are those that attempt to mitigate specific formative information or events it can target modeling normal behaviors instruction on a task or giving information on the event management reviews of studies have found that combination therapy psychological and pharmacotherapy is no more effective than psychological therapy alone psychotherapy many forms of psychotherapy have been found to be efficacious for traumarelated problems such as ptsd basic counseling practices common to many treatments for ptsd include education about the condition and provision of safety and supportthe psychotherapy approaches with the strongest demonstrated efficacy include cognitive behavioral therapy prolonged exposure therapy cognitive therapy ct cognitive processing therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing emdra metaanalytic comparison of emdr and cognitive behavioral therapy found both protocols indistinguishable in terms of effectiveness in treating ptsd however the contribution of the eye movement component in emdr to treatment outcome is unclear a metaanalysis in children and adolescent also found that emdr was as efficacious as cognitive behavioral therapy cbtfurthermore the availability of schoolbased therapy is particularly important for children with ptsd children with ptsd are far more likely to pursue treatment at school because of its proximity and ease than at a free clinic cognitive behavioral therapy cbt seeks to change the way a person feels and acts by changing the patterns of thinking or behavior or both responsible for negative emotions cbt has been proven to be an effective treatment for ptsd and is currently considered the standard of care for ptsd by the united states department of defense in cbt individuals learn to identify thoughts that make them feel afraid or upset and replace them with less distressing thoughts the goal is to understand how certain thoughts about events cause ptsdrelated stressrecent research on contextually based thirdgeneration behavior therapies suggests that they may produce results comparable to some of the better validated therapies many of these therapy methods have a significant element of exposure and have demonstrated success in treating the primary problems of ptsd and cooccurring depressive symptomsexposure therapy is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that involves assisting trauma survivors to reexperience distressing traumarelated memories and reminders in order to facilitate habituation and successful emotional processing of the trauma memory most exposure therapy programs include both imaginal confrontation with the traumatic memories and reallife exposure to trauma reminders this therapy modality is well supported by clinical evidence the success of exposurebased therapies has raised the question of whether exposure is a necessary ingredient in the treatment of ptsd some organizations have endorsed the need for exposure the us department of veterans affairs has been actively training mental health treatment staff in prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy in an effort to better treat us veterans with ptsd eye movement desensitization and reprocessing eye movement desensitization and reprocessing emdr is a form of psychotherapy developed and studied by francine shapiro she had noticed that when she was thinking about disturbing memories herself her eyes were moving rapidly when she brought her eye movements under control while thinking the thoughts were less distressingin  shapiro and maxfield published a theory of why this might work called adaptive information processing this theory proposes that eye movement can be used to facilitate emotional processing of memories changing the persons memory to attend to more adaptive information the therapist initiates voluntary rapid eye movements while the person focuses on memories feelings or thoughts about a particular trauma the therapists uses hand movements to get the person to move their eyes backward and forward but handtapping or tones can also be used emdr closely resembles cognitive behavior therapy as it combines exposure revisiting the traumatic event working on cognitive processes and relaxationselfmonitoring however exposure by way of being asked to think about the experience rather than talk about it has been highlighted as one of the more important distinguishing elements of emdrthere have been multiple small controlled trials of four to eight weeks of emdr in adults as well as children and adolescents emdr reduced ptsd symptoms enough in the short term that one in two adults no longer met the criteria for ptsd but the number of people involved in these trials was small and thus results should be interpreted with caution pending further research there was not enough evidence to know whether or not emdr could eliminate ptsd in adults in children and adolescents a recent metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials using metansue to avoid biases related to missing information found that emdr was at least as efficacious as cbt and superior to waitlist or placebo there was some evidence that emdr might prevent depression there were no studies comparing emdr to other psychological treatments or to medication adverse effects were largely unstudied the benefits were greater for women with a history of sexual assault compared with people who had experienced other types of traumatizing events such as accidents physical assaults and war there is a small amount of evidence that emdr may improve reexperiencing symptoms in children and adolescents but emdr has not been shown to improve other ptsd symptoms anxiety or depressionthe eye movement component of the therapy may not be critical for benefit as there has been no major high quality randomized trial of emdr with eye movements versus emdr without eye movements the controversy over effectiveness is likely to continue authors of a metaanalysis published in  stated we found that people treated with eye movement therapy had greater improvement in their symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder than people given therapy without eye movements…secondly we found that that in laboratory studies the evidence concludes that thinking of upsetting memories and simultaneously doing a task that facilitates eye movements reduces the vividness and distress associated with the upsetting memories interpersonal psychotherapy other approaches in particular involving social supports may also be important an open trial of interpersonal psychotherapy reported high rates of remission from ptsd symptoms without using exposure a current nimhfunded trial in new york city is now and into  comparing interpersonal psychotherapy prolonged exposure therapy and relaxation therapy medication while many medications do not have enough evidence to support their use three fluoxetine paroxetine and venlafaxine have been shown to have a small benefit over placebo with many medications residual ptsd symptoms following treatment is the rule rather than the exception antidepressants selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris and serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors snris may have some benefit for ptsd symptoms tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective but are less well tolerated evidence provides support for a small or modest improvement with sertraline fluoxetine paroxetine and venlafaxine thus these four medications are considered to be firstline medications for ptsd benzodiazepines benzodiazepines are not recommended for the treatment of ptsd due to a lack of evidence of benefit and risk of worsening ptsd symptoms some authors believe that the use of benzodiazepines is contraindicated for acute stress as this group of drugs promotes dissociation and ulterior revivals nevertheless some use benzodiazepines with caution for shortterm anxiety and insomnia while benzodiazepines can alleviate acute anxiety there is no consistent evidence that they can stop the development of ptsd and may actually increase the risk of developing ptsd – times additionally benzodiazepines may reduce the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions and there is some evidence that benzodiazepines may actually contribute to the development and chronification of ptsd for those who already have ptsd benzodiazepines may worsen and prolong the course of illness by worsening psychotherapy outcomes and causing or exacerbating aggression depression including suicidality and substance use drawbacks include the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence tolerance ie shortterm benefits wearing off with time and withdrawal syndrome additionally individuals with ptsd even those without a history of alcohol or drug misuse are at an increased risk of abusing benzodiazepines due to a number of other treatments with greater efficacy for ptsd and less risks eg prolonged exposure cognitive processing therapy eye movement desensitization and reprocessing cognitive restructuring therapy traumafocused cognitive behavioral therapy brief eclectic psychotherapy narrative therapy stress inoculation training serotonergic antidepressants adrenergic inhibitors antipsychotics and even anticonvulsants benzodiazepines should be considered relatively contraindicated until all other treatment options are exhausted for those who argue that benzodiazepines should be used sooner in the most severe cases the adverse risk of disinhibition associated with suicidality aggression and crimes and clinical risks of delaying or inhibiting definitive efficacious treatments make other alternative treatments preferable eg inpatient residential partial hospitalization intensive outpatient dialectic behavior therapy and other fastacting sedating medications such as trazodone mirtazapine amitripytline doxepin prazosin propranolol guanfacine clonidine quetiapine olanzapine valproate gabapentin glucocorticoids glucocorticoids may be useful for shortterm therapy to protect against neurodegeneration caused by the extended stress response that characterizes ptsd but longterm use may actually promote neurodegeneration cannabinoids evidence as of  is insufficient to determine if medical cannabis useful for ptsd despite the uncertain evidence use of cannabis or derived products is widespread among us veterans with ptsdthe cannabinoid nabilone is sometimes used offlabel for nightmares in ptsd although some shortterm benefit was shown adverse effects are common and it has not been adequately studied to determine efficacy additionally there are other treatments with stronger efficacy and less risks eg psychotherapy serotonergic antidepressants adrenergic inhibitors the use of medical marijuana for ptsd is controversial with only a handful of states permitting its use for that purpose other  exercise sport and physical activity physical activity can influence peoples psychological and physical health the us national center for ptsd recommends moderate exercise as a way to distract from disturbing emotions build selfesteem and increase feelings of being in control again they recommend a discussion with a doctor before starting an exercise program play therapy for children play is thought to help children link their inner thoughts with their outer world connecting real experiences with abstract thought repetitive play can also be one way a child relives traumatic events and that can be a symptom of trauma in a child or young person although it is commonly used there have not been enough studies comparing outcomes in groups of children receiving and not receiving play therapy so the effects of play therapy are not yet understood military programs many veterans of the wars in iraq and afghanistan have faced significant physical emotional and relational disruptions in response the united states marine corps has instituted programs to assist them in readjusting to civilian life especially in their relationships with spouses and loved ones to help them communicate better and understand what the other has gone through walter reed army institute of research wrair developed the battlemind program to assist service members avoid or ameliorate ptsd and related problems wounded warrior project partnered with the us department of veterans affairs to create warrior care network a national health system of ptsd treatment centers epidemiology there is debate over the rates of ptsd found in populations but despite changes in diagnosis and the criteria used to define ptsd between  and  epidemiological rates have not changed significantly most of the current reliable data regarding the epidemiology of ptsd is based on dsmiv criteria as the dsm was not introduced until the united nations world health organization publishes estimates of ptsd impact for each of its member states the latest data available are for  considering only the  most populated countries ranked by overall agestandardized disabilityadjusted life year daly rate the top half of the ranked list is dominated by asianpacific countries the us and egypt ranking the countries by the maleonly or femaleonly rates produces much the same result but with less meaningfulness as the score range in the singlesex rankings is muchreduced  for women  for men as compared with  for the overall score range suggesting that the differences between female and male rates within each country is what drives the distinctions between the countries united states the national comorbidity survey replication has estimated that the lifetime prevalence of ptsd among adult americans is  with women  more than twice as likely as men  to have ptsd at some point in their lives more than  of men and more than  of women experience at least one traumatic event in their life the most frequently reported traumatic events by men are rape combat and childhood neglect or physical abuse women most frequently report instances of rape sexual molestation physical attack being threatened with a weapon and childhood physical abuse  of men and  of women with lifetime ptsd have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder major depressive disorder  of men and  of women and lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence  of men and  of women are the most common comorbid disorders military combat the united states department of veterans affairs estimates that  vietnam war veterans suffered symptoms of ptsd the national vietnam veterans readjustment study nvvrs found  of male and  of female vietnam veterans to suffer from current ptsd at the time of the study lifetime prevalence of ptsd was  for males and  for females in a reanalysis of the nvvrs data along with analysis of the data from the matsunaga vietnam veterans project schnurr lunney sengupta and waelde found that contrary to the initial analysis of the nvvrs data a large majority of vietnam veterans suffered from ptsd symptoms but not the disorder itself four out of five reported recent symptoms when interviewed – years after vietnama  study from georgia state university and san diego state university found that rates of ptsd diagnosis increased significantly when troops were stationed in combat zones had tours of longer than a year experienced combat or were injured military personnel serving in combat zones were  percentage points more likely to receive a ptsd diagnosis than their activeduty counterparts in noncombat zones those serving more than  months in a combat zone were  percentage points more likely to be diagnosed with ptsd than those having served less than one year experiencing an enemy firefight was associated a  percentage point increase in the probability of ptsd while being wounded or injured in combat was associated a  percentage point increase in the likelihood of a ptsd diagnosis for the  million us troops deployed in combat zones between  and  the total estimated twoyear costs of treatment for combatrelated ptsd are between  billion and  billionas of  rates of ptsd have been estimated at up to  for veterans returning from iraq and afghanistan as of   of veterans returning from iraq were unemployed manmade disasters the september  attacks took the lives of nearly  people leaving  injured first responders police and firefighters emergency medical services sanitation workers and volunteers were all involved in the recovery efforts the prevalence of probable ptsd in these highly exposed populations was estimated across multiple studies utilizing inperson telephone and online interviews and questionnaires overall prevalence of ptsd was highest immediately following the attacks and decreased over time however disparities were found among the different types of recovery workers the rate of probable ptsd for first responders was lowest directly after the attacks and increased from ranges of  to  between the  year followup and a later assessment when comparing traditional responders to nontraditional responders volunteers the probable ptsd prevalence  years after the initial visit was greater in volunteers with estimates of  and  respectively volunteer participation in tasks atypical to the defined occupational role was a significant risk factor for ptsd other risk factors included exposure intensity earlier start date duration of time spent on site and constant negative reminders of the trauma additional research has been performed to understand the social consequences of the september  attacks alcohol consumption was assessed in a cohort of world trade center workers using the cutannoyedguiltyeye cage questionnaire for alcohol abuse almost  of world trade center workers who selfidentified as alcohol users reported drinking more during the rescue efforts nearly a quarter of these individuals reported drinking more following the recovery if determined to have probable ptsd status the risk of developing an alcohol problem was double compared to those without psychological morbidity social disability was also studied in this cohort as a social consequence of the september  attacks defined by the disruption of family work and social life the risk of developing social disability increased fold when categorized as having probable ptsd veterans  united states the united states provides a range of benefits for veterans that the va has determined have ptsd which developed during or as a result of their military service these benefits may include taxfree cash payments free or lowcost mental health treatment and other healthcare vocational rehabilitation services employment assistance and independent living support united kingdom in the uk there are various charities and service organisations dedicated to aiding veterans in readjusting to civilian life the royal british legion and the more recently established help for heroes are two of britains more highprofile veterans organisations which have actively advocated for veterans over the years there has been some controversy that the nhs has not done enough in tackling mental health issues and is instead dumping veterans on charities such as combat stress canada veterans affairs canada offers a new program that includes rehabilitation financial benefits job placement health benefits program disability awards peer support and family support history the  edition of the dsmi includes a diagnosis of gross stress reaction which has similarities to the modern definition and understanding of ptsd gross stress reaction is defined as a normal personality utilizing established patterns of reaction to deal with overwhelming fear as a response to conditions of great stress the diagnosis includes language which relates the condition to combat as well as to civilian catastropheearly in  the term was used in a working group finding presented to the committee of reactive disorders the condition was added to the dsmiii which was being developed in the s as posttraumatic stress disorder in the dsmiv the spelling posttraumatic stress disorder is used while in the icd the spelling is posttraumatic stress disorderthe addition of the term to the dsmiii was greatly influenced by the experiences and conditions of us military veterans of the vietnam war due to its association with the war in vietnam ptsd has become synonymous with many historical wartime diagnoses such as railway spine stress syndrome nostalgia soldiers heart shell shock battle fatigue combat stress reaction or traumatic war neurosis some of these terms date back to the th century which is indicative of the universal nature of the condition in a similar vein psychiatrist jonathan shay has proposed that lady percys soliloquy in the william shakespeare play henry iv part  act  scene  lines – written around  represents an unusually accurate description of the symptom constellation of ptsdthe correlations between combat and ptsd are undeniable according to stéphane audoinrouzeau and annette becker onetenth of mobilized american men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between  and  and after thirtyfive days of uninterrupted combat  of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees in fact much of the available published research regarding ptsd is based on studies done on veterans of the war in vietnam a study based on personal letters from soldiers of the thcentury prussian army concludes that combatants may have had ptsd aspects of ptsd in soldiers of ancient assyria have been identified using written sources from – bce these assyrian soldiers would undergo a threeyear rotation of combat before being allowed to return home and were purported to have faced immense challenges in reconciling their past actions in war with their civilian lives connections between the actions of viking berserkers and the hyperarousal of posttraumatic stress disorder have also been drawnthe researchers from the grady trauma project highlight the tendency people have to focus on the combat side of ptsd less public awareness has focused on civilian ptsd which results from trauma exposure that is not combat related  and much of the research on civilian ptsd has focused on the sequelae of a single disastrous event such as the oklahoma city bombing september th attacks and hurricane katrina disparity in the focus of ptsd research affects the already popular perception of the exclusive interconnectedness of combat and ptsd this is misleading when it comes to understanding the implications and extent of ptsd as a neurological disorder dating back to the definition of gross stress reaction in the dsmi civilian experience of catastrophic or high stress events is included as a cause of ptsd in medical literature the  national comorbidity survey reports that the traumas most commonly associated with ptsd are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women because of the initial overt focus on ptsd as a combat related disorder when it was first fleshed out in the years following the war in vietnam in  ann wolbert burgess and lynda lytle holmstrom defined rape trauma syndrome rts in order to draw attention to the striking similarities between the experiences of soldiers returning from war and of rape victims this paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of causes of ptsdthe dsmiv classified ptsd under anxiety disorders but the dsm created a new category called trauma and stressorrelated disorders in which ptsd is now classified terminology the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders does not hyphenate post and traumatic thus the dsm lists the disorder as posttraumatic stress disorder however many scientific journal articles and other scholarly publications do hyphenate the name of the disorder viz posttraumatic stress disorder dictionaries also differ with regard to the preferred spelling of the disorder with the collins english dictionary  complete and unabridged using the hyphenated spelling and the american heritage dictionary of the english language fifth edition and the random house kernerman websters college dictionary giving the nonhyphenated spelling research most knowledge regarding ptsd comes from studies in highincome countriesto recapitulate some of the neurological and neurobehavioral symptoms experienced by the veteran population of recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan researchers at the roskamp institute and the james a haley veteran’s hospital tampa have developed an animal model to study the consequences of mild traumatic brain injury mtbi and ptsd in the laboratory the researchers exposed mice to a repeated session of unpredictable stressor ie predator odor while restrained and physical trauma in the form of inescapable footshock and this was also combined with a mtbi in this study ptsd animals demonstrated recall of traumatic memories anxiety and an impaired social behavior while animals subject to both mtbi and ptsd had a pattern of disinhibitorylike behavior mtbi abrogated both contextual fear and impairments in social behavior seen in ptsd animals in comparison with other animal studies examination of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune responses in plasma revealed a trend toward increase in corticosterone in ptsd and combination groups psychotherapy adjuncts mdma was used for psychedelic therapy for a variety of indications before its criminalization in the us in  in response to its criminalization the multidisciplinary association for psychedelic studies was founded as a nonprofit drugdevelopment organization to develop mdma into a legal prescription drug for use as an adjunct in psychotherapy the drug is hypothesized to facilitate psychotherapy by reducing fear thereby allowing people to reprocess and accept their traumatic memories without becoming emotionally overwhelmed in this treatment people participate in an extended psychotherapy session during the acute activity of the drug and then spend the night at the treatment facility in the sessions with the drug therapists are not directive and support the patients in exploring their inner experiences people participate in standard psychotherapy sessions before the drugassisted sessions as well as after the drugassisted psychotherapy to help them integrate their experiences with the drug the phase  clinical trails of the mdmaassisted psychotherapy was publicized at the end of november  preliminary results suggest mdmaassisted psychotherapy might be effective maps is currently waiting for the fda approval of the phase  as of early research is also investigating using dcycloserine hydrocortisone

       " 'death is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism phenomena which commonly bring about death include aging predation malnutrition disease suicide homicide starvation dehydration and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury in most cases bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after deathdeath – particularly the death of humans – has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion due to the affection for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial bonds with the deceased other concerns include fear of death necrophobia anxiety sorrow grief emotional pain depression sympathy compassion solitude or saudade many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife and also hold the idea of reward or judgement and punishment for past sin etymology the word death comes from old english dēaþ which in turn comes from protogermanic dauþuz reconstructed by etymological analysis this comes from the protoindoeuropean stem dheu meaning the process act condition of dying associated terms the concept and symptoms of death and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums have generated numerous scientific legal and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death when a person has died it is also said they have passed away passed on expired or are gone among numerous other socially accepted religiously specific slang and irreverent terms bereft of life the dead person is then a corpse cadaver a body a set of remains and when all flesh has rotted away a skeleton the terms carrion and carcass can also be used though these more often connote the remains of nonhuman animals as a polite reference to a dead person it has become common practice to use the participle form of decease as in the deceased another noun form is decedent the ashes left after a cremation are sometimes referred to by the neologism cremains a portmanteau of cremation and remains senescence senescence refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and longterm loss of living capacities even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability in the united kingdom for example nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence while around the world it accounts for twothirds of  deaths that take place daily hayflick  moody almost all animals who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from biological aging known in life sciences as senescence some organisms experience negligible senescence even exhibiting biological immortality these include the jellyfish turritopsis dohrnii the hydra and the planarian unnatural causes of death include suicide and homicide from all causes roughly  people die around the world each day of these two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence but in industrialized countries—such as the united states the united kingdom and germany—the rate approaches  ie nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescencephysiological death is now seen as a process more than an event conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of vital signs in general clinical death is neither necessary nor sufficient for a determination of legal death a patient with working heart and lungs determined to be brain dead can be pronounced legally dead without clinical death occurring as scientific knowledge and medicine

phenomenon there are many scientific approaches to the concept for example brain death as practiced in medical science defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceasesone of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from life as a point in time death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends determining when death has occurred is difficult as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death this is difficult due to there being little consensus on how to define life this general problem applies to the particular challenge of defining death in the context of medicineit is possible to define life in terms of consciousness when consciousness ceases a living organism can be said to have died one of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious for example singlecelled organisms another problem is in defining consciousness which has many different definitions given by modern scientists psychologists and philosophers additionally many religious traditions including abrahamic and dharmic traditions hold that death does not or may not entail the end of consciousness in certain cultures death is more of a process than a single event it implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to anotherother definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something in this context death describes merely the state where something has ceased for example life thus the definition of life simultaneously defines deathhistorically attempts to define the exact moment of a humans death have been subjective or imprecise death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat cardiac arrest and of breathing but the development of cpr and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted events which were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances without a functioning heart or lungs life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices organ transplants and artificial pacemakerstoday where a definition of the moment of death is required doctors and coroners usually turn to brain death or biological death to define a person as being dead people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases it is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of consciousness suspension of consciousness must be permanent and not transient as occurs during certain sleep stages and especially a coma in the case of sleep eegs can easily tell the differencethe category of brain death is seen as problematic by some scholars for instance dr franklin miller senior faculty member at the department of bioethics national institutes of health notes by the late s the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time these patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration control temperature excrete wastes heal wounds fight infections and most dramatically to gestate fetuses in the case of pregnant braindead womenthose people maintaining that only the neocortex of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function as evidenced by the death of the cerebral cortex all hope of recovering human thought and personality is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology at present in most places the more conservative definition of death – irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain as opposed to just in the neocortex – has been adopted for example the uniform determination of death act in the united states in  the terri schiavo case brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of american politicseven by wholebrain criteria the determination of brain death can be complicated eegs can detect spurious electrical impulses while certain drugs hypoglycemia hypoxia or hypothermia can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis because of this hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving eegs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions legal the death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions a death certificate is issued in most jurisdictions either by a doctor or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctors declaration of death misdiagnosed there are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then coming back to life sometimes days later in their own coffin or when embalming procedures are about to begin from the midth century onwards there was an upsurge in the publics fear of being mistakenly buried alive and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpses mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the rectum writing in  the physician jc ouseley claimed that as many as  people were buried prematurely each year in england and wales although others estimated the figure to be closer to in cases of electric shock cardiopulmonary resuscitation cpr for an hour or longer can allow stunned nerves to recover allowing an apparently dead person to survive people found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an emergency room this diving response in which metabolic activity and oxygen requirements are minimal is something humans share with cetaceans called the mammalian diving reflexas medical technologies advance ideas about when death occurs may have to be reevaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death as happened when cpr and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death the lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead therefore the concept of informationtheoretic death has been suggested as a better means of defining when true death occurs though the concept has few practical applications outside the field of cryonicsthere have been some scientific attempts to bring dead organisms back to life but with limited success in science fiction scenarios where such technology is readily available real death is distinguished from reversible death cause the leading cause of human death in developing countries is infectious disease the leading causes in developed countries are atherosclerosis heart disease and stroke cancer and other diseases related to obesity and aging by an extremely wide margin the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging leading to various complications known as agingassociated diseases these conditions cause loss of homeostasis leading to cardiac arrest causing loss of oxygen and nutrient supply causing irreversible deterioration of the brain and other tissues of the roughly  people who die each day across the globe about two thirds die of agerelated causes in industrialized nations the proportion is much higher approaching  with improved medical capability dying has become a condition to be managed home deaths once commonplace are now rare in the developed worldin developing nations

world health organization report warnedmany leading developed world causes of death can be postponed by diet and physical activity but the accelerating incidence of disease with age still imposes limits on human longevity the evolutionary cause of aging is at best only just beginning to be understood it has been suggested that direct intervention in the aging process may now be the most effective intervention against major causes of deathselye proposed a unified nonspecific approach to many causes of death he demonstrated that stress decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource adaptation energy the animal dies when this resource is exhausted selye assumed that the adaptability is a finite supply presented at birth later on goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored up to a limit as a capital reserve of adaptation in recent works adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the dominant path in the model of adaptation it is demonstrated that oscillations of wellbeing appear when the reserve of adaptability is almost exhaustedin  suicide overtook car crashes for leading causes of human injury deaths in the us followed by poisoning falls and murder causes of death are different in different parts of the world in highincome and middle income countries nearly half up to more than two thirds of all people live beyond the age of  and predominantly die of chronic diseases in lowincome countries where less than one in five of all people reach the age of  and more than a third of all deaths are among children under  people predominantly die of infectious diseases autopsy an autopsy also known as a postmortem examination or an obduction is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a human corpse to determine the cause and manner of a persons death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present it is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologistautopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes a forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death or for research purposes autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted permission from next of kin may be required for internal autopsy in some cases once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practicesa necropsy is an older term for a postmortem examination unregulated and not always a medical procedure in modern times the term is more often used in the postmortem examination of the corpses of animals cryonics cryonics from greek κρύος kryos meaning icy cold is the lowtemperature preservation of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine with the hope that healing and resuscitation may be possible in the futurecryopreservation of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology the stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent informationtheoretic definition of death it is proposed that cryopreserved people might someday be recovered by using highly advanced technologysome scientific literature supports the feasibility of cryonics many other scientists regard cryonics with skepticism by  more than  people have undergone cryopreservation procedures since cryonics was first proposed in  life extension life extension refers to an increase in maximum or average lifespan especially in humans by slowing down or reversing the processes of aging average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to accidents and age or lifestylerelated afflictions such as cancer or cardiovascular disease extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good diet exercise and avoidance of hazards such as smoking maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes currently the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is calorie restriction theoretically extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by periodic replacement of damaged tissues or by molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissuesa united states poll found that religious people and irreligious people as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension while africans and hispanics have higher rates of support than white people  percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process curedresearchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as biomedical gerontologists they try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called life extensionists or longevists the primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available antiaging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed reperfusion one of medicines new frontiers treating the dead recognizes that cells that have been without oxygen for more than five minutes die not from lack of oxygen but rather when their oxygen supply is resumed therefore practitioners of this approach eg at the resuscitation science institute at the university of pennsylvania aim to reduce oxygen uptake slow metabolism and adjust the blood chemistry for gradual and safe reperfusion location before about  most people in western countries died in their own homes surrounded by family and comforted by clergy neighbors and doctors making house calls by the midth century half of all americans died in a hospital by the start of the st century only about  to  of people in developed countries died outside a medical institution the shift away from dying at home towards dying in a professionalized medical environment has been termed the invisible death the invisible death process was extremely slow and infinitesimal it took many years to shift to this new location where dying was commonly taking place outside the home society and culture in society the nature of death and humanitys awareness of its own mortality has for millennia been a concern of the worlds religious traditions and of philosophical inquiry this includes belief in resurrection or an afterlife associated with abrahamic religions reincarnation or rebirth associated with dharmic religions or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist known as eternal oblivion associated with atheismcommemoration ceremonies after death may include various mourning funeral practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased the physical remains of a person commonly known as a corpse or body are usually interred whole or cremated though among the worlds cultures there are a variety of other methods of mortuary disposal in the english language blessings directed towards a dead person include rest in peace or its initialism ripdeath is the center of many traditions and organizations customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world much of this revolves around the care of the dead as well as the afterlife and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death the disposal of human corpses does in general begin with the last offices before significant time has passed and ritualistic ceremonies often occur most commonly interment or cremation this is not a unified practice in tibet for instance the body is given a sky burial and left on a mountain top proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer ones spiritual attainments into another body reincarnation are subjects of detailed study in tibet mummification or embalming is also prevalent in some cultures to retard the rate of decaylegal aspects of death are also part of many cultures particularly the settlement of the deceased estate and the issues of inheritance and in some countries inheritance taxationcapital punishment is also a culturally divisive aspect of death in most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today the death penalty is reserved for premeditated murder espionage treason or as part of military justice in some countries sexual crimes such as adultery and sodomy carry the death penalty as do religious crimes such as apostasy the formal renunciation of ones religion in many retentionist countries drug trafficking is also a capital offense in china human trafficking and serious cases of corruption are also punished by the death penalty in militaries around the world courtsmartial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice desertion insubordination and mutinydeath in warfare and in suicide attack also have cultural links and the ideas of dulce et decorum est pro patria mori mutiny punishable by death grieving relatives of dead soldiers and death notification are embedded in many cultures recently in the western world with the increase in terrorism following the september  attacks but also further back in time with suicide bombings kamikaze missions in world war ii and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history death for a cause by way of suicide attack and martyrdom have had significant cultural impactssuicide in general and particularly euthanasia are also points of cultural debate both acts are understood very differently in different cultures in japan for example ending a life with honor by seppuku was considered a desirable death whereas according to traditional christian and islamic cultures suicide is viewed as a sin death is personified in many cultures with such symbolic representations as the grim reaper azrael the hindu god yama and father timein brazil a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório a governmentauthorized registry before being able to file for an official death the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório though a public registry law guarantees all brazilian citizens the right to register deaths regardless of their financial means of their family members often children the brazilian government has not taken away the burden the hidden costs and fees of filing for a death for many impoverished families the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing unofficial local cultural burial which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate mortality ratestalking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect with an official embalmer and associated rites eastern societies like india may be more open to accepting it as a fait accompli with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burningtoashes of the same consciousness much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to ones consciousness as ones body dies the belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called eternal oblivion belief that the stream of consciousness is preserved after physical death is described by the term afterlife in biology after death the remains of an organism become part of the biogeochemical cycle animals may be consumed by a predator or a scavenger organic material may then be further decomposed by detritivores organisms which recycle detritus returning it to the environment for reuse in the food chain where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism examples of detritivores include earthworms woodlice and dung beetlesmicroorganisms also play a vital role raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules not all materials need to be decomposed fully coal a fossil fuel formed over vast tracts of time in swamp ecosystems is one example natural selection contemporary evolutionary theory sees death as an important part of the process of natural selection it is considered that organisms less adapted to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring thereby reducing their contribution to the gene pool their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population leading at worst to extinction and more positively making the process possible referred to as speciation frequency of reproduction plays an equally important role in determining species survival an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays according to darwinian criteria much greater fitness than a longlived organism leaving only one extinction extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of taxa reducing biodiversity the moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point because a species potential range may be very large determining this moment is difficult and is usually done retrospectively this difficulty leads to phenomena such as lazarus taxa where species presumed extinct abruptly reappear typically in the fossil record after a period of apparent absence new species arise through the process of speciation an aspect of evolution new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological niche – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition evolution of aging and mortality inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age exceptions include hydra and the already cited jellyfish turritopsis dohrnii which research shows to be biologically immortal the evolutionary origin of senescence remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology gerontology specializes in the science of human aging processesorganisms showing only asexual reproduction eg bacteria some protists like the euglenoids and many amoebozoans and unicellular organisms with sexual reproduction colonial or not like the volvocine algae pandorina and chlamydomonas are immortal at some extent dying only due to external hazards like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident in multicellular organisms and also in multinucleate ciliates with a weismannist development that is with a division of labor between mortal somatic body cells and immortal germ reproductive cells death becomes an essential part of life at least for the somatic linethe volvox algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular genetically regulated part of its life history religious views death is an important subject of religious doctrine buddhism in buddhist doctrine and practice death plays an important role awareness of death was what motivated prince siddhattha to strive to find the deathless and finally to attain enlightenment in buddhist doctrine death functions as a reminder of the value of having been born as a human being being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment therefore death helps remind oneself that one should not that for granted the belief in rebirth among buddhists does not necessarily remove death anxiety since all existence in the cycle of rebirth is considered filled with suffering and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progressesdeath is part of several key buddhist tenets such as the four noble truths and dependent origination judaism death is seen in judaism as tragic and intimidating persons who come into contact with corpses are ritually impure there are a variety of beliefs about the afterlife within judaism but none of them contradict the preference of life over death this is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any commandments philosophy of death there is an extensive philosophical literature on death among the questions philosophers debate arewhat is death how

       " 'mitral insufficiency mi mitral regurgitation or mitral incompetence is a disorder of the heart in which the mitral valve does not close properly when the heart pumps out blood it is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards from the left ventricle through the mitral valve into the left atrium when the left ventricle contracts ie there is regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium mi is the most common form of valvular heart disease signs and symptoms the symptoms associated with mi are dependent on which phase of the disease process the individual is in individuals with acute mi are typically severely symptomatic and will have the signs and symptoms of acute decompensated congestive heart failure ie shortness of breath pulmonary edema orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as symptoms of cardiogenic shock ie shortness of breath at rest cardiovascular collapse with shock cardiogenic shock may be seen in individuals with acute mi due to papillary muscle rupture rupture of a chorda tendinea or infective endocarditis of the mitral valveindividuals with chronic compensated mi may be asymptomatic for long periods of time with a normal exercise tolerance and no evidence of heart failure over time however there may be decompensation and patients can develop volume overload congestive heart failure symptoms of entry into a decompensated phase may include fatigue shortness of breath particularly on exertion and leg swelling also there may be development of an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillationfindings on clinical examination depend on the severity and duration of mi the mitral component of the first heart sound is usually soft and with a laterally displaced apex beat often with heave the first heart sound is followed by a highpitched holosystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the back or clavicular area its duration is as the name suggests the whole of systole the loudness of the murmur does not correlate well with the severity of regurgitation it may be followed by a loud palpable p heard best when lying on the left side a third heart sound is commonly heardin acute cases the murmur and tachycardia may be the only distinctive signspatients with mitral valve prolapse may have a holosystolic murmur or often a midtolate systolic click and a late systolic murmur cases with a late systolic regurgitant murmur may still be associated with significant hemodynamic consequences cause the mitral valve apparatus comprises two valve leaflets the mitral valve annulus which forms a ring around the valve leaflets and the papillary muscles which tether the valve leaflets to the left ventricle and prevent them from prolapsing into the left atrium the chordae tendineae are also present and connect the valve leaflets to the papillary muscles dysfunction of any of these portions of the mitral valve apparatus can cause regurgitationthe most common cause of mi in developing countries is mitral valve prolapse mvp and is the most common cause of primary mitral regurgitation in the united states causing about  of cases myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is more common in women as well as with advancing age which causes a stretching of the leaflets of the valve and the chordae tendineae such elongation prevents the valve leaflets from fully coming together when the valve closes causing the valve leaflets to prolapse into the left atrium thereby causing miischemic heart disease causes mi by the combination of ischemic dysfunction of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the left ventricle this can lead to the subsequent displacement of the papillary muscles and the dilatation of the mitral valve annulusrheumatic fever rf and marfans syndrome are other typical causes mitral valve stenosis mvs can sometimes be a cause of mitral regurgitation mr in the sense that a stenotic valve calcified and with restricted range of movement allows backflow regurgitation if it is too stiff and misshapen to close completely most mvs is caused by rf so one can say that mvs is sometimes the proximal cause of mimr that is stenotic mimr and that rf is often the distal cause of mvs mimr or both mi and mitral valve prolapse are also common in ehlers–danlos syndromessecondary mitral insufficiency is due to the dilatation of the left ventricle that causes stretching of the mitral valve annulus and displacement of the papillary muscles this dilatation of the left ventricle can be due to any cause of dilated cardiomyopathy including aortic insufficiency nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and noncompaction cardiomyopathy because the papillary muscles chordae and valve leaflets are usually normal in such conditions it is also called functional mitral insufficiencyacute mi is most often caused by endocarditis mainly s aureus rupture or dysfunction of the papillary muscle are also common causes in acute cases dysfunction which can include mitral valve prolapse pathophysiology the pathophysiology of mi can be broken into three phases of the disease process the acute phase the chronic compensated phase and the chronic decompensated phase acute phase acute mi as may occur due to the sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or papillary muscle causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle the left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood that goes into the aorta the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium the regurgitant volume the combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventriclein the acute setting the stroke volume of the left ventricle is increased increased ejection fraction this happens because of more complete emptying of the heart however as it progresses the lv volume increases and the contractile function deteriorates thus leading to dysfunctional lv and a decrease in ejection fraction the increase in stroke volume is explained by the frank–starling mechanism in which increased ventricular preload stretches the myocardium such that contractions are more forcefulthe regurgitant volume causes a volume overload and a pressure overload of the left atrium and the left ventricle the increased pressures in the left side of the heart may inhibit drainage of blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins and lead to pulmonary congestion chronic phase  compensated if the mi develops slowly over months to years or if the acute phase cannot be managed with medical therapy the individual will enter the chronic compensated phase of the disease in this phase the left ventricle develops eccentric hypertrophy in order to better manage the larger than normal stroke volume the eccentric hypertrophy and the increased diastolic volume combine to increase the stroke volume to levels well above normal so that the forward stroke volume forward cardiac output approaches the normal levelsin the left atrium the volume overload causes enlargement of the left atrium allowing the filling pressure in the left atrium to decrease this improves the drainage from the pulmonary veins and signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion will decreasethese changes in the left ventricle and left atrium improve the low forward cardiac output state and the pulmonary congestion that occur in the acute phase of the disease individuals in the chronic compensated phase may be asymptomatic and have normal exercise tolerances decompensated an individual may be in the compensated phase of mi for years but will eventually develop left ventricular dysfunction the hallmark for the chronic decompensated phase of mitral insufficiency it is currently unclear what causes an individual to enter the decompensated phase of this disease however the decompensated phase is characterized by calcium overload within the cardiac myocytesin this phase the ventricular myocardium is no longer able to contract adequately to compensate for the volume overload of mitral regurgitation and the stroke volume of the left ventricle will decrease the decreased stroke volume causes a decreased forward cardiac output and an increase in the endsystolic volume the increased endsystolic volume translates to increased filling pressures of the left ventricle and increased pulmonary venous congestion the individual may again have symptoms of congestive heart failurethe left ventricle begins to dilate during this phase this causes a dilatation of the mitral valve annulus which may worsen the degree of mi the dilated left ventricle causes an increase in the wall stress of the cardiac chamber as wellwhile the ejection fraction is less in the chronic decompensated phase than in the acute phase or the chronic compensated phase it may still be in the normal range ie   percent and may not decrease until late in the disease course a decreased ejection fraction in an individual with mitral insufficiency and no other cardiac abnormality should alert the physician that the disease may be in its decompensated phase diagnosis there are many diagnostic tests that have abnormal results in the presence of mi these tests suggest the diagnosis of mi and may indicate to the physician that further testing is warranted for instance the electrocardiogram ecg in longstanding mi may show evidence of left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy atrial fibrillation may also be noted on the ecg in individuals with chronic mitral regurgitation the ecg may not show any of these findings in the setting of acute mithe quantification of mi usually employs imaging studies such as echocardiography or magnetic resonance angiography of the heart chest xray the chest xray in individuals with chronic mi is characterized by enlargement of the left atrium and the left ventricle the pulmonary vascular markings are typically normal since pulmonary venous pressures are usually not significantly elevated echocardiography the echocardiogram is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis of mi color doppler flow on the transthoracic echocardiogram tte will reveal a jet of blood flowing from the left ventricle into the left atrium during ventricular systole also it may detect a dilated left atrium and ventricle and decreased left ventricular functionbecause of inability to obtain accurate images of the left atrium and the pulmonary veins with a transthoracic echocardiogram a transesophageal echocardiogram may be necessary in some cases to determine the severity of mi electrocardiography p mitrale is broad notched p waves in several or many leads with a prominent late negative component to the p wave in lead v and may be seen in mi but also in mitral stenosis and potentially any cause of overload of the left atrium thus psinistrocardiale may be a more appropriate term quantification of mitral insufficiency the degree of severity of mi can be quantified by the regurgitant fraction which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atriumregurgitant fraction                                                                              v                                  m                  i

and vaortic are respectively the volumes of blood that flow forward through the mitral valve and aortic valve during a cardiac cycle methods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography cardiac catheterization fast ct scan and cardiac mrithe echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve from the left atrium to the left ventricle during ventricular diastole and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve in ventricular systole this method assumes that the aortic valve does not suffer from aortic insufficiencyanother way to quantify the degree of mi is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve this is known as the regurgitant orifice area and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve one particular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the proximal isovelocity surface area pisa the flaw of using pisa to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the cardiac cycle which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet treatment the treatment of mitral insufficiency depends on the acuteness of the disease and whether there are associated signs of hemodynamic compromisein acute mi secondary to a mechanical defect in the heart ie rupture of a papillary muscle or chordae tendineae the treatment of choice is mitral valve surgery if the patient is hypotensive prior to the surgical procedure an intraaortic balloon pump may be placed in order to improve perfusion of the organs and to decrease the degree of miif the individual with acute mi is normotensive vasodilators may be of use to decrease the afterload seen by the left ventricle and thereby decrease the regurgitant fraction the vasodilator most commonly used is nitroprussideindividuals with chronic mi can be treated with vasodilators as well to decrease afterload in the chronic state the most commonly used agents are ace inhibitors and hydralazine studies have shown that the use of ace inhibitors and hydralazine can delay surgical treatment of mitral insufficiency the current guidelines for treatment of mi limit the use of vasodilators to individuals with hypertension however any hypertension is treated aggressively eg by diuretics and a lowsodium diet in both hypertensive and normotensive cases digoxin and antiarrhythmics are also indicated also chronic anticoagulation is given where there is concomitant mitral valve prolapse or atrial fibrillation in general medical therapy is noncurative and is used for mildtomoderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgerysurgery is curative of mitral valve regurgitation there are two surgical options for the treatment of mi mitral valve replacement and mitral valve repair mitral valve repair is preferred to mitral valve replacement where a repair is feasible as bioprosthetic replacement valves have a limited lifespan of  to  years whereas synthetic replacement valves require ongoing use of blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke there are two general categories of approaches to mitral valve repair resection of the prolapsed valvular segment sometimes referred to as the carpentier approach and installation of artificial chordae to anchor the prolapsed segment to the papillary muscle sometimes referred to as the david approach with the resection approach any prolapsing tissue is resected in effect removing the hole through which the blood is leaking in the artificial chordae approach eptfe expanded polytetrafluoroethylene or goretex sutures are used to replace the broken or stretched chordae tendonae bringing the natural tissue back into the physiological position thus restoring the natural anatomy of the valve with both techniques an annuloplasty ring is typically secured to the annulus or opening of the mitral valve to provide additional structural support in some cases the double orifice or alfieri technique for mitral valve repair the opening of the mitral valve is sewn closed in the middle leaving the two ends still able to open this ensures that the mitral valve closes when the left ventricle pumps blood yet allows the mitral valve to open at the two ends to fill the left ventricle with blood before it pumps in general mitral valve surgery requires openheart surgery in which the heart is arrested and the patient is placed on a heartlung machine cardiopulmonary bypass this allows the complex surgery to proceed in a still environmentdue to the physiological stress associated with openheart surgery elderly and very sick patients may be subject to increased risk and may not be candidates for this type of surgery as a consequence there are attempts to identify means of correcting mi on a beating heart the alfieri technique for instance has been replicated using a percutaneous catheter technique which installs a mitraclip device to hold the middle of the mitral valve closed surgery indications for surgery for chronic mi include signs of left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction less than  severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than  mmhg at rest or  mmhg during activity and new onset atrial fibrillation epidemiology significant mitral valve regurgitation has a prevalence of approximately  of the population affecting males and females equally it is one of the two most common valvular heart diseases in the elderly references  external links mitraclip film from réalités cardiologiques in frenchechocardiographic features of mitral regurgitation at
